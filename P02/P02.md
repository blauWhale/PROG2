# Banking System Simulation - OOP Implementation

## Overview
This project implements a banking system using Object-Oriented Programming principles to demonstrate inheritance, encapsulation, and class relationships. The system simulates different types of bank accounts with specialized behaviors, a management application, and reporting functionality.

## Class Structure
### Core Classes
- **BankAccount**: Base class that implements fundamental banking operations
- **SavingAccount**: Extension with special interest rates and overdraft capabilities
- **YouthAccount**: Extension with age restrictions and withdrawal limits
- **BankApplication**: Manager class that handles multiple accounts and user interactions
- **TaxReport**: Utility class for generating financial reports

## OOP Principles Demonstrated
### Inheritance
- SavingAccount and YouthAccount extend the base BankAccount class
- Each subclass inherits core functionality while adding specialized behavior
- Method overriding is used to customize withdraw behavior in each account type

### Encapsulation
- Private attributes (using double underscores) protect internal state
- Public methods provide controlled access to functionality
- Each class manages its own data integrity

### Abstraction
- Complex operations like interest calculation are hidden behind simple method calls
- Simulation code interacts with high-level abstractions rather than implementation details

### Polymorphism
- Common interface (deposit, withdraw, get_balance) with different implementations
- Application code can work with any account type through this common interface

## Simulation Design
The simulation demonstrates how these objects work together in a realistic scenario:

- **Account Creation**: Different account types are instantiated with appropriate parameters
- **Financial Operations**: Funds are deposited and withdrawn with account-specific rules
- **Time Simulation**: Interest accrual is simulated over time periods
- **Boundary Testing**: Special cases like withdrawal limits and negative balances are tested
- **Reporting**: Tax information is compiled across different account types

## Key Implementation Features
### Time-Based Interest
The system simulates the passage of time for interest calculations:

### Account Type-Specific Behaviors
- **SavingAccount**: Can go below zero with a 2% charge applied
- **YouthAccount**: Has age restrictions and monthly withdrawal limits

### Account Management
The BankApplication class demonstrates composition by containing and managing multiple account objects:

## Conclusion
This implementation demonstrates how OOP principles enable the modeling of real-world systems through class hierarchies, encapsulation of behavior, and object relationships. The simulation shows how these classes work together to create a functional banking system with specialized account types and management capabilities.
