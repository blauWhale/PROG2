# Banking System Simulation

This project implements a simple banking system with different account types and a simulation to demonstrate key features.

## Bank Application

The BankApplication class manages accounts and provides banking operations:

```python
class BankApplication:
    def __init__(self):
        self.accounts = {}
        self.current_account = None
        
    def authenticate(self, username, password):
        # Authenticates a user
        
    def open_account(self, account_type, identifier, age=None):
        # Creates and stores a new account
        
    def deposit(self, amount):
        # Deposits money to selected account
        
    def withdraw(self, amount):
        # Withdraws money from selected account
```

### Account Types

#### Savings Account

* Has interest rate (default 0.1%)
* Allows overdraft with 2% fee

```python
class SavingAccount(BankAccount):
    def __init__(self, identifier):
        super().__init__(identifier)
        self.__interest_rate = 0.001
        self.__type = "Savings Account"
```

#### Youth Account
* For users under 25 years old
* Higher interest rate (2%)
* Monthly withdrawal limit of 2000

```python
class YouthAccount(BankAccount):
    def __init__(self, identifier, age):
        super().__init__(identifier)
        self.__interest_rate = 0.02
        self.__withdrawal_limit = 2000
```

#### Simulation
The simulation demonstrates:

1. Creating different account types
2. Making deposits and withdrawals
3. Testing special features (withdrawal limits, overdraft)
4. Applying interest
5. Generating a tax report

```python
def run_simulation():
    bank_app = BankApplication()
    bank_app.authenticate("user123", "password")
    
    # Create accounts
    bank_app.open_account("savings", "SA001")
    bank_app.open_account("youth", "YA001", 18)
    
    # Deposit money
    bank_app.select_account("SA001")
    bank_app.deposit(50000)
    
    # Test features
    bank_app.withdraw(55000)  # Overdraft test
```
