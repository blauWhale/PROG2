**Train Connection App**
A simple command-line app to fetch train connections using `transport.opendata.ch` and location info via `geopy`.

### How to Run

1. **Install required dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install requests geopy haversine tinydb
   ```

2. **Start the application**:

   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

   On first run, the database will be automatically initialized via `db_initializer.py`, fetching known cities and train company info.

### Files

* **`train.py`**
  Main entry point for the CLI tool. Manages user input, geolocation, transport connections, logging, and fallback routing logic.

* **`db_initializer.py`**
  Initializes the local TinyDB database (`city_data.json`) with coordinates for major Swiss and French cities and a mapping of European train companies.

* **`city_data.json`**
  TinyDB-based local database storing cities, their coordinates, and train company mappings.

* **`reachability.py`**
  Optional utility script to generate a `reachability_from_<city>.json` file.
  It checks if each city in the database is reachable from a given start city (default: ZÃ¼rich) using the transport API.

* **`reachability_from_zurich.json`**
  Auto-generated file containing connection reachability data from Zurich to all other cities.
